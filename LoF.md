# Annotation of variants in well-known cancer genes
To determine potential disease causing variants (in this study defined as LoF variants) genes associated with BC and OC, which are used for genetic testing, was identified. 32 genes for BC and 25 genes for OC were selected for inclusion in the study.
Variants within these genes were annotated using whole exome sequencing data from 200K individuals in UK Biobank.
