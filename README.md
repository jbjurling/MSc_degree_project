# Rare loss of function variants in breast and ovarian cancer
Identified loss-of-function (LoF) variants in genes that are investigated in the clinic and which are part of different gene panels. These variants were annotated using whole exome sequencing data from 200K individuals in UK Biobank. The number of variants were compared between cases and controls to find significant differences between the two groups.

# Computing polygenic risk scores for breast and ovarian cancer
Polygenic risk scores were computed for breast cancer and ovarian cancer in the UK Biobank cohort. GWAS summary statistics was downloaded from BCAC and OCAC.

See PRS.md for workflow.
