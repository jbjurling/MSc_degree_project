# Master´s Degree project 
Medical Research programme at Uppsala University.

The project was carried out in Åsa Johansson research group at the Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology at Uppsala University. 


# Loss of function variants in breast and ovarian cancer
Identified loss of function (LoF) variants in genes that are investigated in the clinic and which are part of different gene panels. The number of LoF variants were compared between cases and controls to find significant differences between the two groups. 

See GenePanels.md for workflow.


# Computing polygenic risk scores for breast and ovarian cancer
Polygenic risk scores were computed for breast cancer and ovarian cancer separately. Genotype data from females in the UK Biobank cohort was used to conduct the scores. GWAS summary statistics was provided from BCAC and OCAC.

See PRS.md for workflow.
